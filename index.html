    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
    <li><del><strong>Css is not neccesary</strong></del><strong><span class="line"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span></strong>It can cantrol the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>

   <h2 class="three">CSS can be added to HTML Documents in 3 ways:</h2>
   <ul class="unlist">
       <li>inline - by using the style attibute inside HTML elements1</li>
       <li>internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
       <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
       <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS file. However, <strong><span class="last">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal and internal style,</span></strong> because this is easier to demonstrate. and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>

   <p style="color: rgb(169, 0, 0);">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple element ID. on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element, ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
   <p style="color: rgb(169, 0, 0);">In CSS selectors are used to target a special element or range of element on web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of style can be applied to the element.</p>
   <P style="color: rgb(169, 0, 0);">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to whitch a style should be applied.</P>
